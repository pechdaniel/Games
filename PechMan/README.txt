	This is a game that I made using a Framework found online, the concept of the game is to avoid the incomming Faces (obstacles)
and the walls of the window to conserve your lives so you can get a high score.
	The game shows you your score on the Game Over window.

	Note! I have used some frameworks that I found online, but the cuncept of the game and the mecanics were made by me.
	P.S. This was my first game, I made it when I was still in highschool.
