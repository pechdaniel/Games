	This is a game of scramble, the concept of the game is that the program has a list of words or phrases in a text file
and it randomly picks one of them so then it can scramble them, the player has to guess the switches that the computer made in the number
of moves that the computer generates, if not, the player loses the game.
	Enjoy! :)
